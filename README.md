# Welcome to SpecFlow’s documentation!

SpecFlow is a test automation solution for .NET built upon the BDD paradigm. Use SpecFlow to define, manage and automatically execute human-readable acceptance tests in .NET projects (Full Framework and .NET Core).

SpecFlow tests are written using Gherkin, which allows you to write test cases using natural languages. SpecFlow uses the official Gherkin parser, which supports over 70 languages. These tests are then tied to your application code using so-called bindings, allowing you to execute the tests using the testing framework of your choice. You can also execute your tests using SpecFlow’s own dedicated test runner, SpecFlow+ Runner.
